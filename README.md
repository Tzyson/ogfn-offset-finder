# OGFN Offset Finder

This is a offset finder made for OGFN (OG Fortnite), it works universally on any build.
You can get patterns from any universal gameserver like reboot or erbium.

# Guide

Download the src of my offset finder, build it as "Release" and inject it into your fortnite process when you are in lobby.
Then copy any pattern of the offset you want to find and paste it into the fortnite console which pops out after injecting and click enter on your keyboard.
Then in the fortnite console it should print/log your offset.
